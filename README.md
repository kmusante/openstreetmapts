Udacity problem set for k musante
py files are descriptive and each are numbered in accordance with their order in my jupyter notebook
I realize some of the py files were not required but I wanted to include some of the work i did to test my data
I used SF, CA as my data set as it was closest to my home....which was too small to be used for this project.
The URL whene i downloaded my osm file is here:  https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/ and under United States and San Francisco
I recommend you review the pdf first
Sources used include openstreetmaps, Class Lessons, the forums and 1 on 1 expert assistance and stack overflow
